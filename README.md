# Feature Faithfulness Metric (FFM)
This repository contains the implementation of FFM metric proposed during the coursework for INF-8605.

## File Description
- `ffm.py`: Contains the implementation of the FFM metric (see `compute_ffm` function).
- `interpret-resnet.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code used to finetune ResNet models on Caltech101 dataset.
- `interpret-resnet-inference.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code used to compute and visualize LIME, GradCAM and AblationCAM on the finetuned ResNet models. 
- `ffm.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code used to compute and the FFM metric on the finetuned ResNet models.
